            <br>    
            <p>Angular 8 was released on May 28, 2019. Featuring Differential loading for all application code, Dynamic imports for lazy routes, Web workers, TypeScript 3.4 support, and Angular Ivy as an opt-in preview. Angular Ivy opt-in preview includes:[23]</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generated code that is easier to read and debug at runtime.</li>
                <li>Faster re-build time.</li>
                <li>Improved payload size.</li>
                <li>Improved template type checking.</li>
                <li>Backwards compatibility.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><mark>Future Releases</mark></h4>
            <br>
            <p>One of the highlights is the expected release of Ivy[23], a backwards compatible, completely new render engine based on the incremental DOM architecture. Ivy has been engineered with tree shaking in mind, which means that application bundles will only include the parts of Angular source code that is actually used by the application.

                    Each version is expected to be backward-compatible with the prior release. Google pledged to do twice-a-year upgrades.</p>
