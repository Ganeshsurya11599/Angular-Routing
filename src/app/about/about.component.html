            <br>
            <p>Angular was a ground-up rewrite of AngularJS.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Angular does not have a concept of "scope" or controllers, instead it uses a hierarchy of components as its primary architectural characteristic.[6]</li>
                <li>Angular has a different expression syntax, focusing on "[ ]" for property binding, and "( )" for event binding[7]
                    </li>
                <li>Modularity â€“ much core functionality has moved to modules</li>
                <li>Angular recommends the use of Microsoft's TypeScript language, which introduces the following features:</li>
                <li>Static Typing, including Generics</li>
                <li>Annotations</li>
                <li>TypeScript is a superset of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), and is backwards compatible with ECMAScript 5 (i.e.: JavaScript).</li>
                <li>Dynamic loading</li>
                <li>Asynchronous template compilation</li>
                <li>Iterative callbacks provided by RxJS. RxJS limits state visibility and debugging, but these can be solved with reactive add-ons like ngReact or ngrx.</li>
                <li>Support Angular Universal, a technology that runs your Angular application on the server</li>
                <li>Has its own suite of modern UI components that work across the web, mobile and desktop, called Angular Material[8]</li>
